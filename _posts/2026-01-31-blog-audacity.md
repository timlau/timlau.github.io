Audacity is a free and open-source audio editor that has been around for over 20 years. It is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of audio production tasks, from recording and editing to mixing and mastering.

Audacity 4 is under development and a early alpha 2 version is available for testing. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I must say it is looking awesome. The new Qt bases interface is clean and intuitive, and the features are impressive.

Glad to see the progress being made on this project, we really need more Open Source projects that look and work like modern desktop applications.

The Alpha 2 version is available for download [here](https://www.audacityteam.org/next/)

Looking forward to the final release!

**Tantacrul** has released a video about the redesign process of Audacity 4 and rant on Youtube by atension grabers who talks trash about it. Very well made and entertaining video

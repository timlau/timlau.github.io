### Features

### Reaper
Reaper is a great DAW with almost endless posibillities for customization and tweaking for a workflow that fit everybodys need. There is a large commution that have made a lot of great resources free of use.
Reaper contains a lot of included effect but no real instruments besides a simple sample player and a very primities tone generator, so if you are into creating music with virtual intruments you have to get some external plugin to start creating some beats. For recording audio from real intruments, it is a powerhouse. the Learning curve is a steeper, because of the endless number of options and ways to customize and extend Reaper.

### Bitwig Studio
Bitwig Studio is a more traditional modern DAW foXund on windows/Mac, like Ableton, FL Studio, Logic that comes with intruments, effect and samples out of the box, so you can just start making beats without needing extra resources, the ceapest version is a little limited with the included intruments, to get the best instrument you have go to the producer or the full version. It has a more gentle learning curve, but there is a more limitted option to configure it, if it dont fit your ways of working.

## Conclusion
Personal, I use Reaper because, I like to be able to customize it to fit my need and have invested a lot of time to learn it.
I only make music for fun and have no plan to take it to a more professional level, so i don't want to spend to much money on it.
Both DAW are great an work great on Linux and don't feel like Linux support is a second class citizen. It is very nice that so great product exist for Linux user and it takes a lot of developer ressources to make such great products and even if I prefere FOSS software, I have no problems paying for great software and It is very important to support companies make such great software that runs on Linux, both FOSS and commercial software.

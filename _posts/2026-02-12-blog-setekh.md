## Introduction

I have added a new plugin **Setekh** to my [timlau/audio](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/timlau/audio/) COPR repository.

[Setekh](https://fullfxmedia.com/plugins/setekh) is a minimalistic yet sonically powerful distortion plugin from Full FX Media.

It is very simple to use, if you want to a some gentle grit to your track

Setekh is a god of deserts, storms, disorder, violence, and foreigners in ancient Egyptian religion.

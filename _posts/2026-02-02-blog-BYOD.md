By guitar players, building your own pedalboard, has always been a hunt for perfection and cost you a lot of money, but know you can easily can do the same in the virtual domain on your **Fedora** system, without spending any money.

I have just added a new plugin called Build Your Own Distortion (BYOD). To my [timlau/audio](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/timlau/audio/) COPR repository.

[BYOD](https://github.com/Chowdhury-DSP/BYOD) is a guitar effects plugin with a customisable signal chain that allows users to create their own guitar distortion effects. The plugin contains a wide variety of distortion effects from analog modelled circuits to purely digital creations, along with some musical tone-shaping filters, and a handful of other useful signal processors.

The plugin is created by [chowdsp](https://chowdsp.com/), check this video for a demonstration:

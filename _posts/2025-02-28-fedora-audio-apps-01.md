### Ardour
[Ardour](https://ardour.org/) is a multi-channel digital audio workstation (DAW), allowing users to record,
edit, mix and master audio and MIDI projects. It is targeted at audio engineers, musicians, soundtrack editors and composers.

```bash
sudo dnf ardour8
```
{: .nolineno }

### Audacity
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is the worldâ€™s most popular free software for recording and editing audio. 
It does destructive editing, not like most DAW's there is doing non-destructive editing.

![audacity](https://flathub.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdl.flathub.org%2Fmedia%2Forg%2Faudacityteam%2FAudacity%2Fe3b7bcec1d992bcec6dfea86b70a5833%2Fscreenshots%2Fimage-1_orig.webp&w=3840&q=75)

`audacity` exist in the Fedora repositories, in a version with support for some file formats removed for patent reasons.\
`audacity-freeworld` exist in the rpmfusion repository, it contains support for mp3 & ffmpeg imports/exports missing in the fedora package.

I use the [flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.audacityteam.Audacity) version 

```bash
flatpak install org.audacityteam.Audacity --user
```

## Introduction

I have added a new plugin **Loopino** to my [timlau/audio](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/timlau/audio/) COPR repository.

[Loopino](https://github.com/brummer10/Loopino) is a lightweight audio sampler. It allows you to load, trim, and loop audio files with precision, making it ideal for crafting seamless sample loops. With a clean, minimal interface, Loopino fits perfectly into any audio workflow — whether for sound design, live performance, or creative sampling experiments.

It is available as standalone application and as a plugin in CLAP format.
